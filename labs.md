B|University of Bern|Switzerland|conventional|no|in some later measurements, they included an additional error term to account for a lack of fractionation correction|GfellerEtal1961,OeschgerEtal1970
Beta|Beta Analytic|United States|conventional|Beta started normalizing after Beta-70783||Beta2022,KellyEtal2022
Beta|Beta Analytic|United States|AMS|Beta started normalizing after Beta-70783|Beta started doing AMS dating in 1983, but did not change their lab code so it is not known which samples are conventional or AMS|Beta2022,KellyEtal2022
BM|British Museum, London|United Kingdom|conventional|no|As a result of the lack of fractionation correction, they included a 80 year error to account for this, plus a 100 year error for the de Vries effect|BarkerMackey1959
CS|CSIRO Division of Soils Radiocarbon Laboratory|Australia|conventional|yes||BowmanHarvey1983
CSC|CSIRO|Australia|AMS|yes||SieEtal1994
CURL|INSTAAR Laboratory for AMS Radiocarbon Preparation and Research (University of Colorado Boulder)|United States|AMS|yes|14C measurements actually done at NOSAMS|INSTAAR2005
GaK|Gakushuin University|Japan|conventional|marine shells are not corrected for fractionation|Intercomparison of samples from different labs show that GaK dates are likely unreliable|KigoshiEtal1973,Blake1980,Blakeslee1994
GrN|Groningen|Netherlands|conventional|correction is applied to terrestrial material if dC13 is measured, but not to marine carbonates (sea shells) and freshwater carbonates||VogelWaterbolk1972
GSC|Geological Survey of Canada|Canada|conventional|In GSC I, they state no correction for fractionation is made. In GSC VIII, they started to measure d13C for samples less than 5000 years, but they did not correct for fractionation in that list. In GSC IX, they began doing corrections for any samples with a d13C measurement. They used -25 permille for terrestrial material and bones (terrestrial and marine), and unconventionally 0 permille for marine shells. In XXVIII, they state no correction is made for freshwater shells.  In GSC XXXV, they state the same, so this should be the correction for all dates published after GSC IX.|GSC dates are unconventionally reported with 2-sigma error ranges. Note that other Geological Survey of Canada dates from labs like Brock and Isotrace may also be reported in this way.|DyckFyles1962,LowdonBlake1970,LowdonEtal1979,McNeely1989,McNeely2006
