Australian National University|Australia|ANUA|AMS|yes||BirdEtal1999
University of Bern|Switzerland|B|conventional|no|in some later measurements, they included an additional error term to account for a lack of fractionation correction|GfellerEtal1961,OeschgerEtal1970
Beta Analytic|United States|Beta|conventional|Beta started normalizing after Beta-70783||Beta2022,KellyEtal2022
Beta Analytic|United States|Beta|AMS|Beta started normalizing after Beta-70783|Beta started doing AMS dating in 1983, but did not change their lab code so it is not known which samples are conventional or AMS|Beta2022,KellyEtal2022
British Museum, London|United Kingdom|BM|conventional|no|As a result of the lack of fractionation correction, they included a 80 year error to account for this, plus a 100 year error for the de Vries effect|BarkerMackey1959
CSIRO Division of Soils Radiocarbon Laboratory|Australia|CS|conventional|yes||BowmanHarvey1983
CSIRO|Australia|CSC|AMS|yes||SieEtal1994
Gakushuin University|Japan|GaK|conventional|marine shells are not corrected for fractionation|Intercomparison of samples from different labs show that GaK dates are likely unreliable|KigoshiEtal1973,Blake1980,Blakeslee1994
Groningen|Netherlands|GrN|conventional|correction is applied to terrestrial material if dC13 is measured, but not to marine carbonates (sea shells) and freshwater carbonates||VogelWaterbolk1972
Geological Survey of Canada|Canada|GSC|conventional|In GSC I, they state no correction for fractionation is made. In GSC VIII, they started to measure d13C for samples less than 5000 years, but they did not correct for fractionation in that list. In GSC IX, they began doing corrections for any samples with a d13C measurement. They used -25 permille for terrestrial material and bones (terrestrial and marine), and unconventionally 0 permille for marine shells. In XXVIII, they state no correction is made for freshwater shells.  In GSC XXXV, they state the same, so this should be the correction for all dates published after GSC IX.|GSC dates are unconventionally reported with 2-sigma error ranges. Note that other Geological Survey of Canada dates from labs like Brock and Isotrace may also be reported in this way.|DyckFyles1962,LowdonBlake1970,LowdonEtal1979,McNeely1989,McNeely2006

University of Helsinki|Finland|Hel|conventional|From date list III onwards, if d13C was measured, the dates were corrected for fractionation. Date lists I and II did not, even if measured. All samples from Hel-2278 were measured for d13C||JungnerSonninen1989,JungnerSonninen1996
Teledyne Isotopes|United States|I|conventional|no||BuckleyValdesPages1981
Illinois State Geological Survey|United States|ISGS|conventional|yes||KellyEtal2022
Copenhagen Carbon-14 Laboratory, National Museum|Denmark|K|conventional|Early reports (Copenhagen IV) state no. However according to Funder (1982), it seems that they did, except that marine shells were unconventionally normalized to 0 permille|In Copenhagen III, they state that 200 +/- 40 should be added to all of the dates due to a change in standards to correct for the Seuss effect. In Copenhagen IV, they state due to not correcting for fractionation, the laboratory rounded all errors that were lower than 100 years to 100 years. This was true up to their last date list (X), but some later reported ages were below that.|Tauber1960,Tauber1960a., Funder, S., 1982. 14C-dating of samples collected during the 1979 expedition to North Greenland.

La Jolla, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, University of California|United States|LJ|conventional|Samples were corrected from 1971, any date list after VI should be corrected (LJ-2000 to LJ-2300), those before likely not||HubbsEtal1960,Linick1977

Humble Oil|United States|O|conventional|not stated, but likely not based on the fact that their early measurements were likely done without any knowledge of the fractionation effect|Only two date lists came out before Humble Oil was completely purchased by Standard Oil in 1959. The lab appears to have continued operating into the 1960s, but the operating procedures are unknown.|BrannonEtal1957b
