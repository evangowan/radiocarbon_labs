country: United States
fractionation_notes:
- notes: No determinations of C13/C12 were made, so it is unlikely a correction was
    made
  reference: Ralph1959
  year: 1959
- notes: They mention that fractionation effects are being determined through the
    measurement of the C13/C12 ratios, but this appears to only apply to their wood
    sample that they use for calibration"

uncertainty_notes:
- notes: They included an uncertainty of Â±0.1 counts/min to account for uncertainties
    in the age of the known age samples. Also note that they consider "BP" to be relative
    to 1958 in this list, rather than 1950
  reference: Ralf1955
  year: 1955
- notes: Dates on this list are corrected to "zero", so presumably that is 1950
  reference: RalphAckerman1961
  year: 1961
- notes: They explicitly state that the ages were set to 1950 for 0 BP
